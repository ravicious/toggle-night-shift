# Toggle Night Shift

Toggle Night Shift toggles Night Shift, duh!

FYI, if you don't need to be able to change it by running an app, you may be better of opening the sidebar, scrolling to the top and toggling Night Shift from there (it's next to the Do Not Disturb toggle).

## Installation

1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/ravicious/toggle-night-shift/releases/latest).
2. Put it into the Applications folder.
3. Go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility.
4. Add the Toggle Night Shift app. Otherwise the app won't be able to change the system settings.

And you're ready to go!
